<h2>Justin L. Ripley</h2>

<h3>Current position</h3>

<p>I am a graduate student at Princeton University.
My thesis adviser is
<a href="http://physics.princeton.edu/~fpretori/">Frans Pretorius</a>.
</p>

<h3>Research Interests</h3>
<p>The main goal of most of my research is directed towards
testing General Relativity (GR) in the strong field, dynamical regime.
I am interested in using gravitational waves to look for
dark matter/deviations from the Standard Model of particle physics as well.

I have worked on analyzing the mathematical consistency of modified
gravity theories used in tests of GR and invoked in early universe cosmology.
I have plans to solve modified gravity theories in (relatively)
more astrophysically realistic setups, for use in gravitational
wave data analysis (and potentially for use in cosmology as well).
Recently, I have begun working on understanding the regime of validity of
linear black hole perturbation theory to understand the ringdown
of a black hole formed after the merger. 
I have mostly used techniques in numerical relativity and perturbation theory.
