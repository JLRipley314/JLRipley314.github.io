<h3>Current position</h3>

<p>I will be starting a position at Cambridge University
(<a href="https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/">DAMTP</a>)
in the fall of 2020.
</p>
<!--========================================================================-->
<h3>Graduate School</h3>
<p>I obtained my PhD from 
<a href="https://phy.princeton.edu/">Princeton University Physics Department</a>.
My adviser was
<a href="http://physics.princeton.edu/~fpretori/">Frans Pretorius</a>.
A pdf of my thesis can be found <a href="thesis/thesis.pdf">here</a>.

<h3>Research Interests</h3>

<p>The main goal of most of my research is directed towards
testing General Relativity (GR) in the strong field, dynamical regime.
Below I describe some of my current and past research projects.
Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions/would like
to get involved!

<h4> Nonlinear strong field dynamics of modified gravity theories </h4>

I am currently working on numerically solving for the equations of motion
of a fairly wide class of modified gravity theories that involve adding
a new scalar field to the Einstein equations,
which couples to the gravitational (metric) field in such as way so that
all the equations of motion are second order in derivatives
(``Horndeski theories''). 
Horndeski theories have been invoked to model a wide variety of gravitational
phenomena, from dark energy to dark matter, to new ``exotic compact object''
solutions, <em> all </em> of which may be strongly constrained by gravitaional
wave observations, provided one can solve for the nonlinear dynamics of these
theories to compare their predictions with those of GR. 
Horndeski theories have recently been shown to admit a
well-posed initial value problem, which opens up the possibility of
actually solving for the dynamics of these theories in strong field,
dynamical regimes such as black hole mergers.

<h4> Black hole perturbation theory </h4>

I am currently working on understanding the leading nonlinear dynamics of
gravitaional wave interactions near Kerr black holes.
More specifically, I am working on developing
<em> second order </em> perturbation theory for Kerr black holes in
a computationally feasible way.
This work is motivated by a desire to understand the regime of applicability
of linear perturbation theory in describing the ringdown of a Kerr black hole
formed after the merger of two black holes/compact objects. 

I am interested in applying my work on second order perturbation
black hole perturbation
theory to working on problems on the gravitational self-force problem.
