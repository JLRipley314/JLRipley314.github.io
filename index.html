<h3>Current position</h3>

<p>I am a research associate at the
(<a href="https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/">Department of Applied Math and Theoretical Physics</a>)
at the University of Cambridge.
</p>
<!--========================================================================-->
<h3>Education</h3>
<p>I obtained my PhD from the 
<a href="https://phy.princeton.edu/">Department of Physics</a>,
Princeton University.
My adviser was

<h3>Research Interests</h3>

<p>The main goal of most of my research is directed towards
testing General Relativity (GR) in the strong field, dynamical regime.
Below I describe some of my current and past research projects.

<h4> Nonlinear strong field dynamics of modified gravity theories </h4>

I am currently working on numerically solving for the equations of motion
of a fairly wide class of modified gravity theories that involve adding
a new scalar field to the Einstein equations,
which couples to the gravitational (metric) field in such as way so that
all the equations of motion are second order in derivatives
(``Horndeski theories''). 
Horndeski theories have been invoked to model a wide variety of gravitational
phenomena, from dark energy to dark matter, to new ``exotic compact object''
solutions. Many Horndeski theories have been strongly constrained by gravitational
wave observations, but at least from some variants of the theory
the strongest constraints
(or perhaps the most unsuspected surprises!) will come
from comparing the predictions of these theories to those of GR
in the strong field dynamical regime, such as near the moment of
merger of two black holes. 
Horndeski theories have recently been shown to admit a
well-posed initial value problem, which opens up the possibility of
actually solving for the dynamics of these theories in that regime.

<h4> Black hole perturbation theory </h4>

I am currently working on understanding the leading nonlinear dynamics of
gravitational wave interactions near Kerr black holes.
More specifically, I am working on developing
<em> second order </em> perturbation theory for Kerr black holes in
a computationally feasible way.
This work is motivated by a desire to understand the regime of applicability
of linear perturbation theory in describing the ringdown of a Kerr black hole
formed after the merger of two black holes/compact objects.
This project should provide a quantitative estimate of
how well linear perturbation theory does, and provide a means to explore
phenomena such as the proposed onset of ``gravitational wave turbulence''
around rapidly rotating (near extremal) Kerr black holes.
