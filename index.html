<h3>Current position</h3>

<p>I am a postdoctoral research associate at the
<a href="https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/">Department of Applied Math and Theoretical Physics</a>
at the University of Cambridge.
</p>
<!--========================================================================-->
<h3>Education</h3>
<p>I obtained my PhD from the 
<a href="https://phy.princeton.edu/">Department of Physics</a>,
Princeton University.
My adviser was
<a href="http://physics.princeton.edu/~fpretori/">Frans Pretorius</a>.
My thesis: <a href="thesis/thesis.pdf">pdf</a>.

<h3>Research Interests</h3>
<p>
Currently I work on constructing classical solutions to the Einstein
equations (of General Relativity), and scalar-tensor modified gravity theories.
More broadly though, what really motivates my work is that
I am interested in finding surprising results from physical mathematical models. 

For example, I have investigated how modified gravity
theories could break down in ways completely different from what
could happen in general relativity. In particular, I have shown
that some scalar-tensor theories can dynamically
suffer a breakdown in hyperbolicity.
Currently I am working on solving a class of scalar-tensor theories
that can be motivated by effective field theory arguments.
As these theories have solutions that violate the Null Convergence Condition,
which lies at the heart of most of the classical theorems of black hole
and cosmological dynamics, these theories will likely offer a host of
surprising solutions, which we have only just begun to seriously explore
with some mathematical rigor!

While Einstein's General Relativity has been studied for over 100 years,
the theory may still offer surprising results. One particular itch I've been
working to scratch is understanding how similar the Einstein equations
are to the Navier-Stokes equations of classical fluid dynamics
(here the surprise would be: when General Relativity was first formulated,
no one thought it would have any similarities with classical fluids; the
Einstein equations simply look nothing like the Navier Stokes equations).
Some researchers have found results that suggest that gravitational waves
could behave in a way similar to a two-dimensional fluid near the surface
of a nearly-extremal Kerr black hole.
I am working with physicists and mathematicians
on devising novel ways to solve the Einstein equations
to explore solutions in the nearly-extremal case.

For my research I mostly use the tools of
numerical relativity and perturbation theory.
A great feature of using numerical methods is that one can construct
concrete, specific solutions, which could be potentially compared with
actual observational data (e.g. I have worked on computing the
gravitational and scalar waves produced by two inspiraling black holes
in scalar-tensor theories).

For a more detailed overview of my past research projects, it's probably best
to look at a list of my publications (see the links below).

<h3>Free online resources for scientific computing</h3>
<p>
   Resources on numerical methods/scientific computing:
<ul>
   <li>  
   <a href="https://physics.princeton.edu//~fpretori/group_resources/index.html">Frans Pretorius' page on numerical methods (mostly about finite difference methods)</a>
   </li>
   <li>  
   <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jpboyd/">John Boyd's webpage (includes link to a pdf of his book on pseudospectral methods)</a>
   </li>
</ul> 
  
   While there are many great resources on C/C++ and Python for scientific
computing, it can be harder to find good resources on <em>modern</em> Fortran
(i.e. Fortran 90,95, and especially 2003 and 2018).
I've found the below websites useful:
<ul>
   <li> 
   <a href="https://fortran-lang.org/">fortran-lang.org</a>
   </li>
   <li> 
   <a href="https://medium.com/modern-fortran">modern-fortran blog</a>
