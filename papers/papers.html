<h3>Neutron stars</h3>
<p>
The internal physics of neutron remains and active research topic. 
I have worked on determining the gravitational wave signatures of out-of-equilibrium processes that could occur inside a neutron star as in orbits another star or black holes.

<h3>Black hole ringdown</h3>
<p> 
Black holes are entirely described by their mass and spin (and their electrical charge).
Perturbed black holes ``ring down'' to a Schwarzschild (non-spinning) or Kerr (spinning) black hole end state.
I have worked on understanding the limits of the applicability linear perturbation theory in describing
the ringdown of a black hole, by helping to develop a second-order perturbative formalism.
I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/JLRipley314/teuk-fortran-2020">code</a> 
which implements that formalism, which has been used in several subsequent projects.

<h3>Modified gravity</h3>
<p>
Black holes produce the strongest gravitational forces in the universe.
Near these objects, general relativity (GR) may break down, or be modified by new physics. 
I have focused on determining which modified theories are predictive, and developing numerical techniques to extract physical predictions from the theories that are predictive.
