<h2>Collected notes on various topics in physics</h2>
<p>
These notes are too pedagogical to be published, but I wrote them up while starting new projects.
Please let me know if you find any typos or errors!

  <li>
   <a href="newman_penrose_formalism.pdf">Newman-Penrose formalism.</a>
   This is essentially Chapter 1 of Chandrasekhar's book ''The Mathematical Theory
   of Black holes'', some notes on the GHP formalism, and notes on different
   coordinates and tetrads for the Kerr spacetime.
   I also wrote a 
   <a href="https://github.com/JLRipley314/2nd-order-teuk-derivations">Mathematica notebook</a>
   that derives the Newman-Penrose equations.

   Notes I have written up while working on a few projects.
