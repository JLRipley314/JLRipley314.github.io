<h2>Collected notes on various topics in physics</h2>
<p>
These notes are too pedagogical to be published, but I wrote them up while starting new projects.
Please let me know if you find any typos or errors!

<h2>Newman-Penrose formalism</h2>
<p>
This is essentially Chapter 1 of Chandrasekhar's book ''The Mathematical Theory
of Black holes'', some notes on the GHP formalism, and notes on different
coordinates and tetrads for the Kerr spacetime.
I also wrote a mathematica that derives the Newman-Penrose equations, and goes through a lot of different coordinate systems for the Kerr spacetime as well.

<h2>Covariant perturbations of spherically symmetric spacetimes</h2>
<p>
Notes I have written up while working on a few projects.
There are a few nice articles on this subject (which are cited in the notes), but I wanted to redo the calculations to double check.
