<h2>Collected notes and projects on statistics and learning</h2>
<p>
Various notes and projects related to statistics and learning algorithms, 
as I slowly learn this large and rapidly evolving field.
None of this has gone through a rigorous editing or peer review process.
I am posting this here as I've learned much from other people's notes and blogs 
on statistics, so perhaps these will be useful to someone.
If anything is unclear, if you find any mistakes, or if you have any suggestions
for improvement, please let me know.
The repository for the paper is <a href="https://github.com/JLRipley314/Statistics-Notes">here</a>.

<h2>Notebooks on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods</h2>
<p>

My solutions (in the form of Pluto notebooks) to a set of instructive MCMC problems originally posed by <a href="https://physics.montana.edu/directory/faculty/1524008/neil-cornish">Neil Cornish</a>.
There are many high quality packages to perform MCMC sampling; these notes/solutions are just for pedagogical use!
These notebooks may contain errors. 
Please let me know if you spot any, or if you would like to improve these solutions in any way.
The source code for these notebooks can be found <a href="https://github.com/JLRipley314/MCMC-Examples">here</a>.

<h2>Predicting drought in the U.S. West</h2>
<p>
Various attempts to train a neural network to guess how much of a given county will be in drought next week given previous drought data.
This is a jupyter notebook, and I used pytorch. 
I took my data from the <a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/">U.S. Drought monitor</a>, and the particular data I downloaded is linked to below.
