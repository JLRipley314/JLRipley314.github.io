<h2>Collected notes and projects on statistics and learning</h2>
<p>
Various notes and projects related to statistics and learning algorithms, 
as I slowly learn this large and rapidly evolving field.
None of this has gone through a rigorous editing or peer review process.
I am posting this here as I've learned much from other people's notes and blogs 
on statistics, so perhaps these will be useful to someone.
If anything is unclear, if you find any mistakes, or if you have any suggestions
for improvement, please let me know.

<h2>Example Pluto notebooks on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods</h2>
<p>
I wrote a few example Pluto notebooks (a ``reactive'' notebook) on MCMC methods.
There are many high quality packages to perform MCMC sampling.
Nevertheless, I found it very helpful to write a few basic example MCMC codes and apply them
to a simple examples, which is what constitutes these notebooks.
These notebooks may contain errors. 
Please let me know if you spot any, or if you would like to improve the notebooks in any way.
