I am currently a postdoctoral research associate at the [Department of Physics](https://physics.illinois.edu) at the
[University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/)

From 2020-2022 I was a postdoctoral research associate at the [Department of Applied Math and Theoretical Physics](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/)
at the University of Cambridge.

My [CV](cv/cv_jripley.pdf).
   
## Research interests

Broadly speaking my research has been in theoretical gravitational physics and gravitational wave astrophysics. 
I have done work in numerical relativity, black hole ringdown, modified gravity, neutron star physics, and relativistic fluids.

My publications can be found on my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=a7k5tZ8AAAAJ&hl=en).

## Software

My [Github account](https://github.com/JLRipley314).
I have also worked with a couple of numerical relativity codes: 

1. The **gh3d2m** code
   (contact [William East](https://www2.perimeterinstitute.ca/personal/weast/)
   and/or
   [Frans Pretorius](https://physics.princeton.edu//~fpretori/)
   for access to the source code). 

2. The [GRChombo collaboration](https://www.grchombo.org/">GRChombo collaboration)

## Notes

Notes from a few projects. Please let me know if you find any typos or errors!

1. [Newman-Penrose formalism](notes/newman_penrose_formalism.pdf)
   This is essentially Chapter 1 of Chandrasekhar's book ''The Mathematical Theory
   of Black holes'', some notes on the GHP formalism, and notes on different
   coordinates and tetrads for the Kerr spacetime.
   I also wrote a 
   [Wolfram Mathematical Notebook](https://github.com/JLRipley314/2nd-order-teuk-derivations) 
   that derives the Newman-Penrose equations. 

2. [Perturbations of spherically symmetric spacetimes.](notes/spherical_perturbations.pdf)
   Notes on gauge-invariant perturbations of the Einstein tensor.
